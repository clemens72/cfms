                        The <b>Central Ohio Folk Festival celebrates its 29th year</b> with a warmer date. It has moved its traditional beginning of May event to the first full weekend in June: <b>June 6 & 7, 2026.</b>  The festival also announces a new location. It&apos;s moving from Highbanks Metro Park to the brand new <b>Bank Run Metro Park located in Lockbourne, Ohio.</b> With the new space comes a new focus: an event space with a larger capacity.  From the north side of town, it&apos;s ONLY an additional ten minute drive and easily accessible via interstates. The site was the previous home of the sizable annual Musicians Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Music Festival.

                        Join us for an incredible two-day event where the magic of music comes alive across four vibrant stages. The festival <b>attracts more than 12,000 over the two days</b> from Central Ohio and beyond, yet retains an attractive smaller community vibe. The gathering features scores of musical performances by touring and local artists, showcasing folk, bluegrass, old-time, and roots music in both traditional and contemporary eclectic mixes.

                        Festival goers can experience engaging jam tents and participate in community song and drum circles. For musicians and the curious, there are 30 workshops covering a myriad of topics and instruments, including beginner workshops. For families, there is a wide array of kids&apos; crafts, performances and storytelling, and the popular Instrument Petting Zoo.
